# URGP
These are the scripts I made whilst making a game in unity.

The initial intention was to learn the basic movement from Genshin Impact.
But I quickly got to that point. Then I moved onto just making foundational
elements such as lockon or being able to play any animation without an animator,
but also be able to blend into or out of it. After that the intention was to
loosely follow valkryia chronicles blitz system but recent Unity CEO statements
has made me rethink a bit. Therefore I'm trying to work on Unreal Engine for now.
